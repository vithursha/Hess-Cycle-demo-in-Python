# Hess-Cycle-demo-in-Python

Exothermic – a reaction that gives out energy and heats the surrounding (negative DeltaH value)
Endothermic – a reaction that takes in energy and cools the surrounding (positive DeltaH value)
 
Enthalpy of Combustion 
Is the enthalpy change when 1 mole of a fuel (in this case hydrocarbon) is burnt completely in oxygen under standard condition (at 273 K and 1 atm pressure) 
The enthalpy change of combustion can be obtained using 2 different methods: 

1. Theoretically (using Hess cycles)
2. Practically (using experimental data and Q = mcDeltaT)

This program will allow you to calculate the enthalpy change using the theoretical method (using the standard enthalpy of formation data ) or the practical method (by carrying out the calculation.
